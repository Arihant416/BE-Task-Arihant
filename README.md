# Task: Create a Scraping Tool

I'm penning down whatever steps I've followed throughout the task in this markdown file.

Steps:

1. Since I need to create a basic automation tool which will scrape data and do couple of things (not relevant now).
I need an environment to setup fastapi and scraping library

```bash
python -m venv .

pip install fastapi requests beautifulSoup4

```

2. Define my model based on the model described in the assignment requirements. Nothing to change there, a straight forward Product model.
  
3. Create a basic blueprint (class) for what my crawler's going to accept.
